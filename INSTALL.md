# Installation Instructions

## macOS Installation

1. **Download** `dave-1.0.0-Darwin.dmg`
2. **Open** the DMG file (double-click)
3. **Drag** `dave.app` to the Applications folder
4. **First Launch**: 
   - **Right-click** on `dave.app` in Applications
   - Select **"Open"** from the context menu
   - Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
5. **Future Launches**: Normal double-click will work

### Why the Security Dialog?

macOS shows this dialog for unsigned applications. This is normal and safe - many indie apps work this way. After the first launch, you can open the app normally.

### System Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- 64-bit Intel or Apple Silicon Mac
